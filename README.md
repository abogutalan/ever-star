# RAG APP: Semantic search with Elasticsearch, OpenAI, and LangChain

### Project Name: Semantic Scholar: An Advanced Semantic Search Engine

### Description:

Designed an advanced semantic search engine called "Semantic Scholar" leveraging Elasticsearch, OpenAI's Language Model (GPT), LangChain, and FastAPI. This robust engine provides the ability to interact with large volumes of text and answer complex queries by extracting the most relevant content.

Implemented using Elasticsearch, a popular search and analytics engine, it indexes data and responds to complex queries at rapid speeds. OpenAI's Language Model (GPT) was utilized for its capacity to understand and generate human-like text. LangChain, a library specifically designed for interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), was deployed to handle routine tasks such as text extraction and indexing. FastAPI, a modern and fast web framework, was used for building the APIs.

This project showcases a practical implementation of semantic search, demonstrating effective data indexing, information retrieval, and relevance mapping using cutting-edge technologies.

Technologies: Python, Elasticsearch, OpenAI GPT, LangChain, FastAPI.

### Setting up env
```
python3 -m venv .venv
